## **1. Introduction**  
This document outlines the high-level technical design of the Email Triage System, a solution designed to automate the processing, classification, and routing of incoming emails, particularly for commercial bank loan servicing. The system aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and response times by leveraging AI technologies.  

---  

## **2. Goals**  
- Automate the initial triage of incoming emails.  
- Accurately classify email intent and extract relevant information.  
- Suggest the appropriate servicing team for each email.  
- Detect and flag near-duplicate emails.  
- Store processed email data for future reference and analysis.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface to view triaged emails.  

---  

## **3. System Architecture**  
The Email Triage System adopts a modular, multi-tier architecture comprising the following key components:  

### **3.1 Components Overview**  
- **Email Fetcher:** Connects to an email inbox (IMAP), identifies unseen emails, and retrieves content (subject, sender, body, and attachments).  
- **Email Processor:** The core component that analyzes fetched emails, including:  
  - **Content Extraction:** Parses email structure and extracts relevant text.  
  - **Attachment Processor:** Handles PDF, HTML, and image attachments to extract textual content.  
  - **Intent Classifier & Information Extractor:** Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) via LangChain to classify intent and extract key data points.  
  - **Assignee Suggester:** Suggests the appropriate servicing team based on extracted data.  
  - **Embedding Generator:** Creates vector embeddings using a Sentence Transformer model.  
  - **Duplicate Detector:** Queries a vector database (MongoDB Atlas) to find semantically similar emails.  
- **Data Storage:** Stores raw and processed email data, embeddings, and duplicate flags in MongoDB Atlas.  
- **Backend API:** Provides a RESTful API (FastAPI) for frontend data retrieval.  
- **Frontend UI:** A web interface (Streamlit) allowing users to view processed emails.  

### **3.2 Component Interactions & Data Flow**  
1. The **Email Fetcher** retrieves new emails from the configured IMAP server.  
2. The **Email Processor** extracts textual content from email and attachments.  
3. The **Intent Classifier & Information Extractor** determines intent and extracts entities.  
4. The **Assignee Suggester** recommends a servicing team.  
5. The **Embedding Generator** creates vector embeddings for similarity searches.  
6. The **Duplicate Detector** identifies near-duplicate emails using MongoDB Vector Search.  
7. Processed data is stored in **MongoDB Atlas**.  
8. The **FastAPI Backend** provides API endpoints for the frontend.  
9. The **Streamlit Frontend** retrieves data via API calls and displays triaged emails.

## **4. Performance Optimizations**  
- **Batch Processing & Asynchronous Handling:** Emails are processed in parallel using Python's **asyncio** and **Celery** for background tasks.  
- **Indexing in MongoDB:** Utilizes **compound indexes** on key fields like subject, sender, and embedding vectors for fast queries.  
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed queries (e.g., duplicate searches) use **Redis** to reduce database load.  
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Prevents API overuse using FastAPI middleware.

## **5. Enhanced Data Model**  
### **MongoDB Schema** (Collection: `emails`):  
```json  
{  
  "subject": "Loan Request Update",  
  "sender": "customer@example.com",  
  "recipients": ["agent@bank.com"],  
  "body": "Requesting status update on loan #12345.",  
  "attachments": [{ "name": "loan.pdf", "content": "base64_encoded" }],  
  "main_intent": "Loan Status Inquiry",  
  "request_details": [{ "entity": "Loan Number", "value": "12345" }],  
  "embedding": [0.123, 0.456, ...],  
  "duplicate": false,  
  "duplicate_email_id": null,  
  "duplicate_score": null,  
  "created_at": "2025-03-25T12:00:00Z",  
  "updated_at": "2025-03-25T12:00:00Z"  
}  
```
---  

## **6. Observability & Error Handling**  
- **Logging:** Implemented via **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and FastAPI logging.  
- **Monitoring:** System metrics tracked using **Prometheus** and visualized in **Grafana**.  
- **Alerting:** **PagerDuty** or **Slack Alerts** notify on failures (e.g., IMAP disconnection, API timeouts).  
- **Retries & Circuit Breakers:** Handled using **Tenacity** for API calls and **Hystrix** patterns to prevent cascading failures.  
- **Database Failover Strategy:** Configured **MongoDB Atlas replica sets** for high availability.  

---  

## **7. Deployment Considerations**  
- **Containerization:** All services (FastAPI, Streamlit, workers) run in **Docker** containers.  
- **Cloud Deployment:** Uses **Kubernetes (GKE/AWS EKS)** for scalability.  
- **Security Measures:**  
  - **Environment Variables:** API keys and credentials stored securely.  
  - **Access Control:** Role-based authentication with OAuth2.  
  - **Data Encryption:** Emails stored with **AES-256 encryption**.  
  - **TLS Encryption:** All API communications secured via **HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3)**.
