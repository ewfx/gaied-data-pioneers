# üìß LoanServ AI ‚Äì Intelligent Email Classification & Processing System

## 1. Introduction

This project is an AI-powered email triage system designed to automate the processing and classification of incoming emails, particularly for commercial bank loan servicing. It aims to solve the problem of manually sorting and routing emails, which is often time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. The system analyzes email content, identifies the intent, extracts relevant information, and suggests the appropriate servicing team to handle the request. Additionally, the system performs a duplicate check to highlight near duplicate emails to save time in manual reviews.

## 2. Demo

Unfortunately, a publically available demo for this project isn't currently hosted. However, the `UI.html` file in the `src/frontend` directory provides a basic interface to display processed email data fetched from the backend. To see this information displayed, follow the setup steps outlined in the "How to Run" section to run the entire project locally.

## 3. Inspiration

This solution was inspired by the need to streamline email processing in customer service and loan servicing departments. Specific inspiration came from:

*   **Efficiency Improvements:** Reducing the manual effort required to handle a large volume of emails.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Minimizing errors in email classification and routing.
*   **Faster Response Times:** Enabling faster responses to customer inquiries and requests.
*   **Existing AI-Powered Solutions:** Leveraging the power of modern language models and vector search techniques for natural language processing.

## 4. What It Does

The Email Triage System provides the following key features:

*   **Email Fetching:** Connects to an IMAP server to retrieve unseen emails.
*   **Content Extraction:** Extracts the subject, sender, body, and attachments from emails.
*   **Text Extraction from Attachments:** Extracts text from PDF, HTML, and image attachments using libraries like PyMuPDF, BeautifulSoup, and Google Cloud Vision API, respectively.
*   **Intent Classification:** Uses a large language model (LLM) to classify the email's main intent and identify specific request details.
*   **Information Extraction:** Extracts key information from the email content, such as customer name, account ID, urgency, and relevant keywords.
*   **Assignee Suggestion:** Recommends the appropriate servicing team based on the identified intent and keywords.
*   **Embedding Generation:** Generates email embeddings using Sentence Transformers for semantic similarity search.
*   **Duplicate Detection:** Performs vector search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to identify near-duplicate emails based on their embeddings.
*   **Data Storage:** Stores the extracted data, classification results, and embeddings in a MongoDB database.
*   **User Interface:** Provides a basic web-based user interface (UI) to view the processed emails and their analysis results.
*	**API Endpoints**: Provides an API endpoint to fetch email records from the MongoDB database.

### **Key Features**

‚úÖ **Automated Email Processing & Classification**  
Automatically fetches, analyzes, and categorizes incoming emails, reducing manual effort. Uses LLM-driven intent recognition (Google Gemini API via LangChain) to accurately identify primary and secondary intents.

## 5. How We Built It

The system was built using a combination of Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, and various libraries for natural language processing and data storage. The following methodologies and technologies were used:

*   **FastAPI:** A modern, high-performance web framework for building the backend API.
*   **Streamlit:**  A Python library used to create a simple web UI for displaying the processed emails.
*   **LangChain:** A framework for developing applications powered by language models. Used to build the email processing pipeline.
*   **Google Gemini API:** Used for classifying the intent of an email and identifying request details.
*   **Sentence Transformers:** Used to generate email embeddings for semantic similarity search.
*   **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:** Used to store the embeddings and perform efficient vector search for duplicate detection.
*   **PyMuPDF (fitz):** Used for extracting text from PDF attachments.
*   **BeautifulSoup:** Used for parsing HTML content in emails.
*   **Google Cloud Vision API:** Used for performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on image attachments.
*   **IMAPlib:** Used for connecting to and fetching emails from an IMAP server.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Aimed for separation of concerns and testability.

## 6. Challenges We Faced

During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges:

*   **Accurate Intent Classification:** Ensuring the LLM accurately classifies the intent of emails with varying language styles and content. This was addressed by using a well-defined prompt and fine-tuning the prompt through extensive testing.
*   **Extracting Text from Attachments:** Handling different attachment types and extracting text accurately. We implemented dedicated extraction methods for PDF, HTML, and image files. Google Cloud Vision API rate limits were also a concern, and error handling was implemented to manage those.
*   **Duplicate Detection:** Finding an efficient and reliable method for identifying near-duplicate emails. We implemented vector search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, which provided good performance and accuracy.  The right threshold was determined by testing the score generated by the vector search.
*   **Managing API Keys and Credentials:** Securely storing and accessing API keys and database credentials. We used environment variables and avoided committing sensitive information to the repository.
*   **Scalability**: The system is currently configured to fetch from an IMAP Server and process the data. This will need to be enhanced to handle large volumes of data in a real-time production environment.
*   **Error Handling and Monitoring**: The system can benefit from better error handling, monitoring, and logging capabilities to ensure stable operation.

    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add the following variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

        ```
		EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"             
		EMAIL_PASS="your_email_app_password"          
		MONGODB_USERNAME="your_mongodb_username"        
		MONGODB_PASSWORD="your_mongodb_password"       
		GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key"    
		MODEL_NAME="gemini-pro"                        
		PROMPT_FILE_PATH="prompt.md"                  
		DUPLICATE_CHECK_THRESHOLD="0.9"               
		CREDENTIALS_PATH="cloud-vision-api-key.json"   

        ```

        *   **Gmail App Password:** If you're using Gmail, generate an App Password and use that for `EMAIL_PASS`.
        *   **Google AI API Key:** Obtain a Google AI API key from the Google AI Studio.
        *   **Google Cloud Vision API:** Follow the steps mentioned above to get the Google Cloud Vision API credentials JSON.

5.  **MongoDB Setup:**

    *   Create a MongoDB Atlas account and a cluster.
    *   Create a database named `email-triage`.
    *   Create a user with read and write permissions for the `email-triage` database.
    *   Create a `emails` collection in the `email-triage` database, this is where the information will be stored.
    *   Create a vector search index on the `embedding` field.  You can do this through the MongoDB Atlas UI.  The index should be of type "vector search".  You'll need to choose the appropriate settings for your embeddings (e.g., dimension, similarity metric). I'd recommend the following values:
        *   **Index Name:** email\_embedding
        *   **Database and Collection:** email-triage.emails
        *   **Field Mappings:**
                * `embedding`:  Type: `vector`, Dimensions: 384 (since you are using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, it creates 384 dimension vectors), Similarity: `cosine`

6.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```

    This will start both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.
