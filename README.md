## 7. üöÄ How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd gaied-data-pioneers
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Conda Environment:**

    ```bash
    conda create -n email_triage python=3.12 # or 3.11, or 3.12
    conda activate email_triage
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add the following variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

        ```
		EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"             
		EMAIL_PASS="your_email_app_password"          
		MONGODB_USERNAME="your_mongodb_username"        
		MONGODB_PASSWORD="your_mongodb_password"       
		GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key"    
		MODEL_NAME="gemini-pro"                        
		PROMPT_FILE_PATH="prompt.md"                  
		DUPLICATE_CHECK_THRESHOLD="0.9"               
		CREDENTIALS_PATH=""   

        ```

        *   **Gmail App Password:** If you're using Gmail, generate an App Password and use that for `EMAIL_PASS`.
        *   **Google AI API Key:** Obtain a Google AI API key from the Google AI Studio.
        *   **Google Cloud Vision API:** Follow the steps mentioned above to get the Google Cloud Vision API credentials JSON.

5.  **MongoDB Setup:**

    *   Create a MongoDB Atlas account and a cluster.
    *   Create a database named `email-triage`.
    *   Create a user with read and write permissions for the `email-triage` database.
    *   Create a `emails` collection in the `email-triage` database, this is where the information will be stored.
    *   Create a vector search index on the `embedding` field.  You can do this through the MongoDB Atlas UI.  The index should be of type "vector search".  You'll need to choose the appropriate settings for your embeddings (e.g., dimension, similarity metric). I'd recommend the following values:
        *   **Index Name:** email\_embedding
        *   **Database and Collection:** email-triage.emails
        *   **Field Mappings:**
                * `embedding`:  Type: `vector`, Dimensions: 384 (since you are using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, it creates 384 dimension vectors), Similarity: `cosine`

6.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```

    This will start both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.

7.  **Access the UI:** Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8501` to access the Streamlit UI.
