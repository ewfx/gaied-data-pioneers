Hi HR Team,

I hope you're doing well. I have a few questions regarding *employee
benefits*:

   1.

   Can you provide details on the *company-provided health insurance plan*,
   including coverage limits and dependents eligibility?
   2.

   I heard we have a *discounted gym membership program*. How can I enroll?
   3.

   What are the steps to update my *emergency contact details* in the HR
   portal?
   4.

   Can I get a confirmation on my *paid leave balance* for this year?

Please let me know if I need to submit any forms for these requests.
Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,
*James Anderson*
Employee ID: *EMP123456*
